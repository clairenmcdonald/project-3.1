             <h1>Coolin, Priest Lake, Idaho</h1>
             <p>One of my favorite cities is Coolin in Priest Lake, Idaho! This is a place I have gone to since childhood, as my aunt has a cabin right on the lake. It is a beautiful area full of fun lake activities, a very small town, and wildlife such as moose, mountain goats and bears. Though very small, Coolin has a few small shops, the best huckleberry icecream and some great restaurants nearby.</p>
